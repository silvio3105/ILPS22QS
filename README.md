# SHT40 I2C Driver

This is frameworkless I2C driver for ILPS22QS absolute pressure & temperature sensor.
Driver does not depend on framework (eg., Arduino or nRF5 SDK). External handlers for I2C read and write operations have to be provided during object construction. It is written in C++.

Driver documentation is available at `Documentation/html/index.html`
Example applications are available at `Examples` folder. All examples are made with nRF5 v17.1.0 framework and tested with `ILPS22QSTR` sensor on custom hardware for TPMS project.
