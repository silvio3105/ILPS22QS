# ILPS22QS I2C/SPI Driver

This is frameworkless I2C/3-wire SPI driver for ILPS22QS absolute pressure & temperature sensor. It is written in C++ using CRTP pattern.
Driver does not depend on framework (eg., Arduino or nRF5 SDK). External handlers for interface operations have to be provided during object construction.

Driver documentation is available at `Documentation/html/index.html`
Example applications are available at `Examples` folder. All examples are made with STM HAL framework and tested with `ILPS22QSTR` sensor(on sTPMS_SEN1 PCB) and BluePill(`STM32F103C8`).

The driver is developing by TPMS DIY project needs. Not every feature is supported and/or tested.
